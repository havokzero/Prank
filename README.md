### 🚨 Disclaimer
This program is intended strictly for educational and research purposes.

## 🎯 Key Features

- 🖼️ **Wallpaper Changer**: Randomly changes the desktop background.
- 🖱️ **Mouse Cursor Swap**: Replaces the default mouse cursor with a prank cursor.
- 🗑️ **Desktop Clutter**: Adds empty icons to the desktop.
- 🔊 **Audio Effects**: Plays humorous or annoying sounds to enhance the prank.
- ⏳ **Fake Terminal with Countdown**: A custom terminal window simulates a file encryption process, complete with a countdown timer in the title bar. The user is led to believe their files are being encrypted.
- 🔑 **Backdoor to Stop the Prank**: A hard-coded password can be entered into the fake terminal to stop the prank immediately, functioning as a "safety switch."
- 🌀 **Random GIF Popups**: At random intervals and positions, the screen fills with spinning GIFs to further disorient the user. These popups add a visual layer of confusion and surprise.

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

Once the prank is started, it will immediately begin making changes to the desktop environment as described above. The prank also opens a **custom terminal window** that pretends to encrypt files, complete with a countdown timer displayed in the window's title bar.

- **Countdown Simulation**: The countdown timer creates a sense of urgency, making the user believe their files are being encrypted. However, this is purely a visual trick and does not actually affect any files.
- **GIF Popups**: At random intervals, spinning GIFs (such as the one below) will appear on the screen in random positions, adding further chaos to the prank.

- **Web Browser Hijinks**: The prank opens the web browser and performs searches for menial jobs (e.g., "dishwasher jobs," "janitorial jobs"). Simultaneously, it plays audio clips taunting the user to "get a job."

- **Stopping the Prank**: To stop the prank, the user can either close the application via Task Manager or enter the **hard-coded password** into the fake terminal. The password acts as a backdoor and will immediately halt the prank and restore normal desktop functionality.

- **Hard-coded Password**: The password to stop the prank is: `YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE`. 

    *(Make sure to customize this password in your code for security and functionality purposes.)*
